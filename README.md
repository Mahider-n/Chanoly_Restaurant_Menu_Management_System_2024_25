# Chanoly Restaurant Menu Management

Welcome to **Chanoly Restaurant Menu Management System**, a full-stack application designed to streamline menu management for restaurants. The system provides two main roles:

1. **User**: Can register, log in, and view the restaurant's menus.
2. **Admin**: Can create, read, update, and delete menu items.

This project is implemented using **NestJS** for the backend and **TypeScript** for the frontend. The project is organized as a **monorepo** with separate folders for the backend and frontend, each requiring independent setup and installation of dependencies.
